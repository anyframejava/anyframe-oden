				<para>
					In this document, the server in which file will be deployed is called Target Server.
				</para>
			</footnote>
			Agent is installed in Target Server in which file will be deployed, 
			and deploys files according to the commands of Oden Server. 
			Oden Server manages several Agents, 
			and user gives commands to Oden Server through GUI environment such as command line and Oden Admin. 
			User cannot directly give commands to Agent, but only through Oden Server.

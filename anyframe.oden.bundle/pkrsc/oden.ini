# Oden system log. (eg. [/path/to/oden]/meta/log_[yyyymmdd].log)

# "3" is "info", and "4" is "debug".

# log.level = 1
log.level = 1

# Ports: Set ports for Anyframe Oden uses. Anyframe Oden Server requires
# "http.port" and "shell.port". If it has its own Agent, it also requires
# "agent.port". Anyframe Oden Agent only requires "agent.port".
#
# "http.port"
# http.port is a port for HTTP connection for Anyframe Oden GUI environment.
# At the Anyframe Oden GUI environment (eg. Anyframe Oden Eclipse plug-in)
# needs to have Anyframe Oden Server profile with the designated port.
# "shell.port"
# shell.port is a port for TELNET connection for Anyframe Oden CLI (shell)
# environment. Users should use this port when they connect Anyframe Oden
# via CLI environment. (eg. telnet)
# "agent.port"
# agent.port is a port used by Anyframe Oden Agent, for its own works.
# Each Agent should have only ONE port, and this port should be described in
# Anyframe Oden Server's configuration file:
# [/path/to/oden]/conf/config.xml
# shell.port = 9861
http.port = 9860
